        "-   Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.\n",
        "-   OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well suited for software that is large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications.\n",
        "-   The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial for collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.\n",

        "-   In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a data structure that contains both data (attributes/properties) and methods (functions or procedures) that operate on the data. Classes encapsulate the attributes and behaviors that are common to all objects of that class, promoting code reuse and organization.\n",

When you send a message to an object, you are asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods. From a programming point of view, an object can be a data structure, a variable or a function. It has a memory location allocated. The object is designed as class hierarchies.\n",

        "-   The ____ call ____ method is part of Python build-in methods also called dunder or magic methods because have two prefixes and suffix underscores in the method name. The main idea of ____ call ____ method is to write a class and invoke it like a function. We can refer to it as callable object.\n",
        "-   In Python, the ____ call ____ method provides a way to use instances of classes as if they were functions. This provides flexibility, as it allows classes to exhibit function-like behavior, while still maintaining their nature as objects of a class. The ____ call ____ method also allows instances to maintain state between calls, which can be highly useful in various programming scenarios.\n",
